Class/Module usage is awesome and provides a lot of flexibility. It would be really awesome to be able to use the joy of Ruby to construct html. 

What about the other templating Ruby systems that are so awesome?
- ERB: Makes the developer write HTML with all its little its angle bracket inefficiencies.
- HAML: Eases this pain, by drying up the markup, but the developer it isn't Ruby
- Markaby: Is Ruby, but operates in the singleton space taking away much of the power of ruby. It is filled with phenomenal meta-magic, that can also be hard to debug.
- Erector: Tries to solve this gap in the Ruby landscape but has a hard to negotiate DSL, fraught with the wrong types of suprises.  

What if you could have short and sweet markup dsl with all the joys of Ruby. You would have ???
