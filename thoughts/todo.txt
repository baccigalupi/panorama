better locals
  - accessors
  - exceptions for local name overlaps with html tags
pages
  - proxy for inline rendering with a block
partials
  - erb and haml proxies should receive file objects as content
  - partial( file object or dir string )
  - partial(:erb, file object or dir string) as different syntax for erb( file or dir )
publishing:
  - css and sass to an external file
  - js to an external file
  - external files should warn and indicate where they came from
  - pages can inline these files, or they can be published to a public location and html included
